Previously worked in an insights function at a financial services firm or a marketing/advertising agency
Have a strong grasp of big data disciplines, Agile (scrum) methodologies, and new technologies
Are proficient with Business Intelligence (BI) tools (e.g. Tableau, Shiny Dashboards)

PARC, a Xerox company, is in the Business of Breakthroughs®. Practicing open innovation, we provide custom R&D services, technology, expertise, best practices, and intellectual property to Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies, startups, and government agencies and partners. We create new business options, accelerate time to market, augment internal capabilities, and reduce risk for our clients. Since its inception, PARC has pioneered many technology platforms – from the Ethernet and laser printing to the GUI and ubiquitous computing – and has enabled the creation of many industries. Incorporated as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox in 2002, PARC today continues the research that enables breakthroughs for our clients' businesses.
The Hardware Research and Technology Laboratory (HRTL) at PARC is a group of multi-disciplinary scientists and engineers who enjoy the opportunity to invent and develop new technologies, foster innovation, and launch new businesses. The Sensor Devices and Systems group within HRTL is looking for an intern to work on machine learning (ML)-enabled biosensors for approximately three months this summer. This project will focus on implementing a new method for interpreting sensor data in the presence of unknown confounding variables. The ultimate goal of this work is to build a software pipeline that can accurately infer biomolecule concentration from experimental sensor data in the presence of uncontrolled confounding variables (e.g., other molecules, variable salt concentration, etc…). The software pipeline should also be able to suggest additional measurements that can increase the accuracy of the inferred biomolecule concentration. A successful candidate will be comfortable implementing machine learning and Bayesian inference concepts using Python while also acquiring and working with real, experimental data.
Responsibilities:
Run machine learning models combined with physics based models
Under the guidance of an electrochemist, convert chemical system models into Python code for use by an electrochemical simulation software package
Collect experimental bio-sensor data in the presence and absence of confounding variables
Run electrochemical simulations and compare simulation outputs to experimental data to evaluate model predictive power. Refine the models as appropriate to improve predictive power.
As needed, build computationally efficient surrogate models to approximate simulation response and/or to correct for non-ideal effects that aren’t captured by simulations
Build a software pipeline that can take experimental sensor data as an input and return a confidence interval for biomolecule concentration along with suggested measurements that can be run to narrow the confidence interval.
Communicate research findings within PARC and, as appropriate, with the broader research community
Contribute to invention disclosures and scientific publications, as appropriate
Qualifications:
Master’s degree or at least two years of a PhD program completed in a quantitative field (e.g., control, robotics, computer science, computational chemistry or materials science, biophysics, bioinformatics, etc…)
Proficient in Python and common packages (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
Proficient in machine learning methods
Some entry-level experience with chemical or biological lab work (making stock solutions, safe handling of hazardous chemicals, etc…)
Experience with automation of lab measurements and/or electrochemical experiments is a plus (but not required)
Creativity and desire to collaborate with colleagues across disciplines
Excellent written and oral communication skills

Axle is seeking a highly ambitious, adaptable, structured, and detail oriented Research Associate - Rare Diseases Data Science to join our rare disease informatics team at Bethesda, MD.
Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983,[1] Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration.
The ORDR’s GARD information center was established in 2003 under a Congressional Mandate (RDA 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. However, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. Recently, GARD has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a Neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in GARD up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. Research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization.

USFS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is available with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station located in Asheville, North Carolina.
This research opportunity is situated within the Eastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center (EFETAC), a dynamic research unit of the US Forest Service’s Southern Research Station. EFETAC scientists engage in diverse ecology research with broad objectives including: evaluating the effects and consequences of multiple interacting stresses (e.g., climate change, invasive species, wildland fire) on forest health; increasing knowledge of the risks, uncertainties, and/or benefits of multiple stresses on ecological conditions and socioeconomic values; and providing science-based decision support tools for policy formulation and land management.
Research Project: Changing forest conditions and attendant changes in the sustainability of forest resources occur within a context of environmental and social change as well as ongoing forest management. This context both constrains the potential for success of various forest management and restoration strategies, and opens up management and conservation opportunities. Our broad goal is to provide understanding of forest sustainability and tools to aid forest management decision-making across the southeastern US. Specific project objectives are guided in part by collaboration with regional partners—the research participant is an integral part of that collaboration.
The Forest Service’s Southern Regional Office has identified priorities to provide applied science to support shared stewardship and improve forest conditions (e.g., ecological condition, recreation opportunities, wildlife habitat, ecosystem services). The Southern Research Station is engaged with the Regional Office in a multi-year collaborative effort to address several challenges in an integrated manner: 1) identifying priorities across multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) prioritizing management actions to efficiently achieve desired outcomes, 3) rigorously evaluating and adjusting program performance.
The participant will interact in a team environment with research collaborators and with forest management professionals to plan, perform and communicate strongly applied analyses that are likely to include quantitative decision analysis (e.g., modeling the consequences of management actions on desired outcomes) and landscape ecological analysis. Research may include integrating spatial and temporal datasets such as remotely sensed data and climate data, and integrating data-driven and expert-driven information. Science communication/transfer includes both peer-reviewed publication and engaging land management partners around project findings and data products. The participant will have access to a rich collection of landscape ecological data as well as planning and assessment datasets and tools that have been developed within Forest Service Research and elsewhere, but will also be expected to be adept at discovering and incorporating novel data sources.
Learning Objectives:
Gain first-hand experience conducting cutting-edge research within a federal agency
Develop skill in interacting with agency partners to develop applied science to meet complex natural resource management and conservation needs
Develop analytical skills with challenges such as harmonizing disparate data types, computational intensity with large data sets, and developing analytical models for applied decision science
Develop science writing and communication skills, as well as project development, leadership, and management skills

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Lars Pomara (lazarus.y.pomara@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor.
Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Summer/Fall 2021. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.
Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be extended upon recommendation of USFS and is contingent on the availability of funds.
Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.
Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The annual stipend will be $79,278 and a travel allowance will also be provided to support occasional overnight travel. An allowance partially covering health insurance cost will be provided.
Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.
ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USFS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USFS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

"Postdoctoral Fellow in Machine Learning

Tumor evolution proceeds at a rapid pace. Drug development does not. In order for cancer therapy to achieve a durable response over years rather than months, it must ""evolve"" as quickly as the tumor does. In contrast to a cell's DNA, its RNA - the transcriptome - is a highly dynamic machinery which operates within ranges, orders of magnitudes wider than those of the genome. Its role of shaping clonal evolution and implementing a cell's response to its environment is undoubted, yet nowhere close to understood. We seek applications from a computer scientist with a PhD and strong background in machine learning to develop general metrics of cell fitness using supervised machine learning approaches. This project is part of our NIH-awarded K99/R00.


Position Highlights:
We develop software solutions that enable data-driven, clinical, decision-making by providing oncologists and specialized tumor-boards with patient-specific genomic information. Executing this mission will rely on a long-term synergy between various evolving perspectives on tumor populations and on an interdisciplinary effort to sharpen these perspectives.
The Ideal Candidate:

 Experience with machine learning approaches, especially supervised methods such as Bayesian MKL, deep neural networks (Bayesian neural nets, LSTM, convolutional) is required. Experience with PyTorch or TensorFlow is also needed. Prior work with very large datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and imaging data pre-processing is preferred but not required. Experience with Java and OO programing concepts is also a plus.


Responsibilities:
Successful candidate will work with a powerful combination of single-cell RNA sequencing data and live-cell imaging to learn various aspects about a clone's fitness from its transcriptome.

 Successful candidate will work closely together with mathematicians towards steering the fitness landscape of coexisting cancer clones in a systematic, directed fashion.

Description
Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.
USFS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is available with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station located in Asheville, North Carolina.
This research opportunity is situated within the Eastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center (EFETAC), a dynamic research unit of the US Forest Service’s Southern Research Station. EFETAC scientists engage in diverse ecology research with broad objectives including: evaluating the effects and consequences of multiple interacting stresses (e.g., climate change, invasive species, wildland fire) on forest health; increasing knowledge of the risks, uncertainties, and/or benefits of multiple stresses on ecological conditions and socioeconomic values; and providing science-based decision support tools for policy formulation and land management.
Research Project: Changing forest conditions and attendant changes in the sustainability of forest resources occur within a context of environmental and social change as well as ongoing forest management. This context both constrains the potential for success of various forest management and restoration strategies, and opens up management and conservation opportunities. Our broad goal is to provide understanding of forest sustainability and tools to aid forest management decision-making across the southeastern US. Specific project objectives are guided in part by collaboration with regional partners—the research participant is an integral part of that collaboration.
The Forest Service’s Southern Regional Office has identified priorities to provide applied science to support shared stewardship and improve forest conditions (e.g., ecological condition, recreation opportunities, wildlife habitat, ecosystem services). The Southern Research Station is engaged with the Regional Office in a multi-year collaborative effort to address several challenges in an integrated manner: 1) identifying priorities across multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) prioritizing management actions to efficiently achieve desired outcomes, 3) rigorously evaluating and adjusting program performance.
The participant will interact in a team environment with research collaborators and with forest management professionals to plan, perform and communicate strongly applied analyses that are likely to include quantitative decision analysis (e.g., modeling the consequences of management actions on desired outcomes) and landscape ecological analysis. Research may include integrating spatial and temporal datasets such as remotely sensed data and climate data, and integrating data-driven and expert-driven information. Science communication/transfer includes both peer-reviewed publication and engaging land management partners around project findings and data products. The participant will have access to a rich collection of landscape ecological data as well as planning and assessment datasets and tools that have been developed within Forest Service Research and elsewhere, but will also be expected to be adept at discovering and incorporating novel data sources.
Learning Objectives:
Gain first-hand experience conducting cutting-edge research within a federal agency
Develop skill in interacting with agency partners to develop applied science to meet complex natural resource management and conservation needs
Develop analytical skills with challenges such as harmonizing disparate data types, computational intensity with large data sets, and developing analytical models for applied decision science
Develop science writing and communication skills, as well as project development, leadership, and management skills

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Lars Pomara (lazarus.y.pomara@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor.
Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Summer/Fall 2021. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.
Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be extended upon recommendation of USFS and is contingent on the availability of funds.
Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.
Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The annual stipend will be $79,278 and a travel allowance will also be provided to support occasional overnight travel. An allowance partially covering health insurance cost will be provided.
Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

"Machine Learning/Computational Biology Post-doctoral Fellow
 - (3143658)
Post-doctoral position available (with flexible start dates) to develop novel machine learning/computational biology approaches to model and understand mammalian microbiomes. Projects include elucidating fundamental rules governing the formation and maintenance of complex microbial ecosystems in the mammalian gut under the National Science Foundation funded project, MTM2: The rules of microbiota colonization of the mammalian gut project (https://gerber.bwh.harvard.edu/mtm-2-the-rules-of-microbiota-colonization-of-the-mammalian-gut) and developing novel computational methods to analyze longitudinal microbiome data under the NIGMS R01 “Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics.”
The position will give you the opportunity to develop advanced machine learning/computational biology methods while working on real, biologically relevant problems. Techniques we use include Bayesian nonparametric models, dynamical systems inference from sparse data, interpretable models, approximate inference methods and relaxations of discrete variables to enable fully-differentiable models.
The candidate is expected to engage with the broader machine learning and computational biology communities by presenting work at top conferences, as well as publishing applications of new methods in high impact journals. Although some experience modeling biological or other complex systems is required, microbiome specific knowledge is not required. This could be a good fit for either someone with a strong machine learning background who wants to get domain-specific research experience, OR someone with a strong mathematical background who wants to get more machine learning experience.
About the lab: the Gerber Lab (http://gerber.bwh.harvard.edu) develops novel statistical machine learning models and high-throughput experimental systems to understand the role of the microbiota in human diseases, and applies these findings to develop new diagnostic tests and therapies. A particular focus of the Gerber Lab is understanding dynamic behaviors of host-microbial ecosystems. Our work in this area includes the fully Bayesian MCTIMME, MDSINE and MITRE algorithms, for discovering temporal patterns in microbiome data, inferring dynamical systems models from microbiome time-series data, or predicting host status from microbiome time-series data with human interpretable rules. We have applied these methods to a number of clinically relevant questions including understanding dynamic effects of antibiotics, infections and dietary changes on the microbiome, and designing bacteriotherapies for C. difficile infection and food allergy. We also apply our methods to synthetic biology problems, to engineer consortia of bacteria for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
Environment: the Gerber Lab is located in the Division of Computational Pathology (http://comp-path.bwh.harvard.edu), which Dr. Gerber heads, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and the Massachusetts Host-Microbiome Center (http://metagenomics.partners.org), which Dr. Gerber co-directs. BWH, an HMS affiliated teaching hospital is adjacent to the HMS main quad and is the second largest non-university recipient of NIH research funding. The broad mandate of the BWH Division of Computational Pathology is to develop and apply advanced computational methods for furthering the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. The Division is situated within the BWH Department of Pathology, which houses over 40+ established investigators, 50+ postdoctoral research fellows, and 100+ research support staff. In addition, BWH is part of the greater Longwood Medical Area in Boston, a rich, stimulating environment conducive to intellectual development and research collaborations, which includes HMS, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston Children’s Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.

PhD in computer science, computational biology, applied mathematics, statistics, or other quantitative discipline
Excellent publication track record
Strong mathematical background with track record developing novel models and methods
Solid programming skills in Python; this isn’t a software engineering job, but you will need to be able to develop efficient implementations and apply your work to real biological data
Experience modeling biological or other complex systems required; microbiome experience desirable, but not required
Superior communication skills and ability to work on multidisciplinary teams
Ability to reside in the U.S. and legally work in the country; there is an opportunity to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, but funding sources require the post-doc to work in the U.S.

Send cover letter, CV and brief research statement to ggerber@bwh.harvard.edu. In your CV, indicate whether you are a U.S. citizen/permanent resident or visa holder (and list visa type.)

"Qualifications:
Required: Applicant must hold a Ph.D. in a relevant subject (e.g. in a data-intensive subfield of Biology, Ecology or Environmental Science) or in computer science (with publications in one of these subfields) with one or more years of research training. It is essential that the applicant have mastery of a set of tools appropriate for working with large-scale data science including application of machine learning. A strong publication record in relevant academic field(s) is also required as is the ability to mentor students and work in a diverse, distributed team in an interdisciplinary manner with an ability to direct one’s own research.

Preferred: Preference will be given to applicants who have experience implementing machine-learning algorithms in an Ecology research context, for example, with data generated from camera traps. Preference will also be given to applicants who have a demonstrated familiarity with data management and image processing tools; a demonstrated interest in citizen science; the ability to work independently and manage multiple projects; excellent organizational, presentation and writing skills; and demonstrated self-motivation and creativity. While based in Minneapolis, the successful applicant will be expected to travel to Chicago and Oxford, England.

The Zooniverse team in the School of Physics and Astronomy at The University of Minnesota has an opening for a Research Associate position with a focus on machine learning and data science applications in Ecology. Through volunteer classifications, Zooniverse projects use the combined input from a large number of imperfect classifiers to enable knowledge discovery from large-scale datasets across the domains. Under the onslaught of even more data and as machine algorithms continue to improve, the Zooniverse team is investigating approaches that optimally combine human and machine classifiers. Zooniverse platform infrastructure has been implemented to enable this combined approach with great success in the Ecology domains. Funding has been obtained to explore applications of this combined approach in solving the problem of identifying individual animals (re-identification) in image or video captures. Furthermore, a collaboration between the Zooniverse and Wildlife Insights was recently funded to connect their APIs allowing for the easy transmission between the two platforms of relevant data sets and metadata including Deep Neural Network labels and crowd classification results for those research teams who want to exploit the benefits of each platform.

The successful applicant will work on several projects related to the extraction of data from camera trap images or video using artificial intelligence. Specific duties will include helping to build linkages between the Zooniverse platform and the Wildlife Insights platform to provide an integrated pipeline for camera trap practitioners, retraining and testing existing algorithms used for current camera trap projects on Zooniverse such as Snapshot Safari, and advancing the capabilities of existing algorithms to improve counts, behaviors, demographic data, and recognition of rare and endangered species as well as mounting experiments using crowd labels and machine learning to enable individual animal identification.

The research associate will be supervised by Lucy Fortson, faculty member in Physics and Astronomy, co-founder of Zooniverse and director of the Zooniverse effort at UMN. The UMN Zooniverse effort comprises science team members across multiple Zooniverse projects including many in Ecology, several data science post-docs working in astronomy, medical imaging and digital humanities, and a dedicated Zooniverse web developer. The successful applicant would also work closely with Zooniverse team members at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago and the University of Oxford, UK who are guiding and developing the Zooniverse platform infrastructure to combine human and machine classifiers; there is a budget for several collaborative visits to these locations for this project. Additionally, the research associate would work closely with the Wildlife Insights team aiming to assist other research teams identified in using the data science infrastructure on both platforms. Strong collaborations exist between the Zooniverse team led by Fortson and the Snapshot Safari Zooniverse project operated out of University of Minnesota’s Lion Center, as well as other UMN ecology teams. The research associate would be given the opportunity to collaborate scientifically with these teams working towards the publication of ecology research exploiting the data obtained through Zooniverse projects. The successful applicant would be expected to work with and directly mentor graduate students from the UMN Data Science Masters program as well as undergraduates from a range of domains, with assistance from several faculty in Computer Science and the Informatics Institute at UMN who are engaged in Zooniverse projects. The position is grant-funded for two years with the possibility of continued funding if further grants are successful.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: Multiple postdoctoral research opportunities are available and located at various facilities with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS).
Research Project: The U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) mission involves problem-solving research in the widely diverse food and agricultural areas encompassing plant production and protection; animal production and protection; natural resources and sustainable agricultural systems; and nutrition; food safety; and quality. The programs are conducted in 46 of the 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For ARS to maintain its standing as a premier scientific organization, major investments in computing, networking, and storage infrastructure are required. Training in data and information management are integral to the integrity, security, and accessibility of research findings, results, and outcomes within the ARS research enterprise. Nearly 2000 scientists and support staff conduct research within the ARS research enterprise.
The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in working on agricultural- and natural resource-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including AI and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high performance computers (HPC). The objective of this fellowship is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or required by the HPC environment. Training will be provided in specific AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistical software needed for the HPC.
Throughout the course of this research project, the participant will learn about conducting agricultural research within the context of the ARS Big Data Initiative (BDI; scinet.usda.gov). The BDI is responsible for three major components: a high-capacity network as the backbone of a research data and information conduit among ARS locations (SciNet); high-performance computing and storage infrastructure available to all ARS scientific staff; and a virtual research support core (VRSC), a group of personnel with diverse skills in scientific computing that provides support and training to ARS scientists and staff. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will have the opportunity to gain experience in and learn about the challenges in predicting dynamics of agro-ecosystems while learning a range of computational skills needed to conduct analyses in an HPC and cloud-based environment.
Learning Objectives: The participant will have the opportunity to learn AI technologies through our AI Center of Excellence, and will develop and co-lead ARS-wide workshops resulting in a community of scientific practice for a multi-disciplinary topic within our National Programs. The participant will also have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists on data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with agro-ecosystem problems across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
USDA-ARS Contact: If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact Debra Peters (deb.peters@usda.gov).
Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.
Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.
Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.
Participant Stipend: The participant(s) will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.
Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.
ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

PARC, a Xerox company, is in the Business of Breakthroughs®. Practicing open innovation, we provide custom R&D services, technology, expertise, best practices, and intellectual property to Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies, startups, and government agencies and partners. We create new business options, accelerate time to market, augment internal capabilities, and reduce risk for our clients. Since its inception, PARC has pioneered many technology platforms – from the Ethernet and laser printing to the GUI and ubiquitous computing – and has enabled the creation of many industries. Incorporated as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox in 2002, PARC today continues the research that enables breakthroughs for our clients' businesses.
The Hardware Research and Technology Laboratory (HRTL) at PARC is a group of multi-disciplinary scientists and engineers who enjoy the opportunity to invent and develop new technologies, foster innovation, and launch new businesses. The Sensor Devices and Systems group within HRTL is looking for an intern to work on machine learning (ML)-enabled biosensors for approximately three months this summer. This project will focus on implementing a new method for interpreting sensor data in the presence of unknown confounding variables. The ultimate goal of this work is to build a software pipeline that can accurately infer biomolecule concentration from experimental sensor data in the presence of uncontrolled confounding variables (e.g., other molecules, variable salt concentration, etc…). The software pipeline should also be able to suggest additional measurements that can increase the accuracy of the inferred biomolecule concentration. A successful candidate will be comfortable implementing machine learning and Bayesian inference concepts using Python while also acquiring and working with real, experimental data.
Responsibilities:
Run machine learning models combined with physics based models
Under the guidance of an electrochemist, convert chemical system models into Python code for use by an electrochemical simulation software package
Collect experimental bio-sensor data in the presence and absence of confounding variables
Run electrochemical simulations and compare simulation outputs to experimental data to evaluate model predictive power. Refine the models as appropriate to improve predictive power.
As needed, build computationally efficient surrogate models to approximate simulation response and/or to correct for non-ideal effects that aren’t captured by simulations
Build a software pipeline that can take experimental sensor data as an input and return a confidence interval for biomolecule concentration along with suggested measurements that can be run to narrow the confidence interval.
Communicate research findings within PARC and, as appropriate, with the broader research community
Contribute to invention disclosures and scientific publications, as appropriate
Qualifications:
Master’s degree or at least two years of a PhD program completed in a quantitative field (e.g., control, robotics, computer science, computational chemistry or materials science, biophysics, bioinformatics, etc…)
Proficient in Python and common packages (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
Proficient in machine learning methods
Some entry-level experience with chemical or biological lab work (making stock solutions, safe handling of hazardous chemicals, etc…)
Experience with automation of lab measurements and/or electrochemical experiments is a plus (but not required)
Creativity and desire to collaborate with colleagues across disciplines
Excellent written and oral communication skills
